# mask_detector

in this project i use mediapipe library to detect and locate faces from video or single image,
then classifiey all faces into two classes (mask,no mask), and put rectangle at these classified faces.
i create my own dataset , train model with this custom dataset in train.ipynb and save the model to reuse it
then load the model in detect.py to classifiey faces
